The main aim of the project is to extract all faculty and staff information from CSUF catalog ( https://catalog.fullerton.edu/content.php?catoid=52&amp;navoid=6265) where all faculty and staff on the page are listed by last name, using Pandas created a data frame FacultyStaff which includes the following four columns: Name, Year, Position, Degree and shortlisted the number of new faculty members &amp; the number of new staff members for each year in the period of 2010-2019. Used a bar plot with different colors to distinguish the results of faculty and staff and another plot to present the number of new faculty or staff members having Ph.D. or J.D. degree for a fixed time period.
